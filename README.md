# Rust-Winget-Bot

This bot automates publishing new Rust releases to the winget package repository shortly after they happen. On GitHub, it should only ever open PRs for new Rust versions.

However, software may misbehave or have bugs. If you have a problem with Rust-Winget-Bot please [file an issue.](https://github.com/Rust-Winget-Bot/my-source-code/issues)

This repo contains the powershell script which I run once a week. You may make PRs against it, and my creator @Xaeroxe will review them.
